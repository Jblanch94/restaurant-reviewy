Restaurant Reviewy
What is Restaurant Reviewy?
Restaurant Reviewy at it's core is a reviewing application for restaurants. It provides user authentication so you know your data will be secure. Users can view reviews for different restaurants without having an account, but to leave a review must have an account and be logged in.

Usage
Once the user opens the application they are brought to the dashboard where they can view all of the restaurants and click to see reviews for that restaurant. If they would like to sign up or login they can navigate to the Sign In page by clicking on Sign In in the navigation bar. If they choose to login or register they can now leave reviews for restaurants if they would like or they can update their profile by clicking on the avatar. 

Planned Features
Some features that are planned to be added in include: having an average rating for each restaurant, a search bar to filter restaurants by the user's input, and a way to filter by category.
